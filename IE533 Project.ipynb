    "### Students in elementary schools are often high-activity and energetic, and it is common for children to get hurt at schools. Furthermore, children are more vulnerable to disease. Due to the above reasons, it is important for parents and teachers to know which hospitals are nearer to the schools. There are two well-equipped hospitals in East district, Hsinchu City. Our problem focuses on three elementary schools with the most students in East district, Hsinchu City. We aim to find out that which hospital is nearer to the targeted schools."
