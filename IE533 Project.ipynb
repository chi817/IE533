    "### Students in elementary schools are often high-activity and energetic, and it is common for children to get hurt at school. Furthermore, children are more vulnerable to diseases. Due to the above reasons, it is important for parents and teachers to know which hospitals are nearer to their schools. There are two well-equipped hospitals in East District, Hsinchu City. Our goal focuses on three elementary schools with the most students in East District, Hsinchu City and aim to find out that which hospital is closer to the targeted schools."
