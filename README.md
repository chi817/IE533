Optimization: Transportation Network Analysis

Project Overview: The primary objective of our project is to determine the shortest routes between the top three populated elementary schools and the two hospitals located in the East District of Hsinchu City, Taiwan. Hsinchu City is a province-administrative city that is often referred to as the Silicon Valley of Taiwan. As elementary school students are highly active and prone to injury and illness, it is crucial for parents and teachers to be aware of the most efficient routes to the nearest hospitals. We implement the following three algoritms and compare the performance and results.
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. Floydâ€“Warshall Algorithm
3. Network Simplex Algorithm

Looking ahead, we plan to address the issue in our study, which is identifying the villages represented by the node numbers on the shortest paths. This will enhance the practicality and applicability of our study.
